# history

the third way

Dont repeat the mistakes of the past

BASIC

turbo pascal, fast small

C, fast but easy to make mistakes, era of low performance so fast is everything. OSs built in C so others follow suit

UNIX, C, designed for low memory and CPU sharing, hardware expensive

Lesson: the fastest software is the best, fasted wins

BUT C is easy to get wrong, memory leaks, crashes due to accessing unallocated or freed pointers.  had several jobs writing business software in C, never do that! #define switches for differnent customers and features, too hard to test all the code paths, dont do this!

Business software would be better off in a higher level language, with memory safety and abstaction.

4GLs e.g. FoxPro, naviagtion record database, easy to get started but easy to find the limits and improssiblemto push past limits and be reliable.  Progress 4GL combine SQL and on at a time record processing. what makes it easy, e.g. data and screen input output also limits it as all screens must work a predefined way.
